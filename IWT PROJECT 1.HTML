        Rajput started his career with television serials.<br>
        His debut show was Star Plus's romantic drama Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil (2008),
         followed by a starring role in Zee TV's soap opera <span style="color:orangered;">Pavitra Rishta (2009–2011).</span>
         <br>While a student at Delhi Technological University, Rajput enrolled in Shiamak Davar's dance classes.
          It was only later that the idea of making a career in acting came to him, as some of his fellow students in the dance classes happened to be interested in acting and was attending Barry John's drama classes.
           Influenced by them, Rajput also joined the acting classes.<br>
            Here, he found his passion for acting: <span>"I found the experience liberating.</span>
             I realised that I could communicate with the audience. 
             I knew I wanted to do this forever."
<br>
         Within a few months of joining the dance class, Rajput was selected to be a member of Davar's standard dance troupe. In 2005, he was chosen to be one of the groups of background dancers at the 51st Filmfare Awards. 
         <br>In 2006, he was part of the troupe that went to Australia to perform in the cultural programme at the opening ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games. By this time, he was tired of engineering. 
         He was happy and successful in the dance and drama classes and decided to do what he was good at.
          He dropped out of engineering and devoted himself full-time to dancing and acting.
