        <h2>M.S. Dhoni:the Untold Story</h2>
        <p>The biopic on India’s celebrated skipper, Mahendra Singh Dhoni (played by Sushant Singh Rajput) is the cricketer’s ode to his well-wishers, friends and family, who stood by him at all times - in success and failure. Their immense contribution in fulfilling his dream, his faith in himself and ability to battle professional and personal setbacks, forms the story. The movie follows the journey of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, a budding cricketer from Ranchi, who became the most successful captain of the Indian Cricket Team. He was a ticket collector before he became a cricketer. The movie begins with the ICC Cricket World Cup Final (India vs Sri Lanka) in the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai where Mahendra Singh Dhoni (Sushant Singh Rajput) is watching the match live on screen. He decides to take the stand, and tells the authorities that he would go for batting if the wicket falls down. Dhoni takes up his bat and leads down the stairs amidst the roar of the crowd. The movie then goes into a flashback in Ranchi, Bihar in 1981, the year Dhoni was born. Dhoni’s alleged rivalry with Yuvraj Singh and a few senior players also finds a mention in the film.</p>

        MS DHONI : THE UNTOLD STORY! AN INDISPUTABLE EFFORT BY SUSHANT SINGH RAJPUT

From the beginning of the movie every one must have understood that their hearts gonna stop for a few moments! And they have not been wrong. I'm not highlighting the plot in detail as I'm pretty much interested not to unfold the story line as many of you will go to watch it.

Let me talk about the best parts. First of all, Sushant's tremendous acting and dedication deserve a big thumbs up. Next Anupam Kher and Rajesh Sharma rightly have adjusted themselves to their spots. Herry Tangri (Yuvi) excellently has scaled himself with his character. Kiara Advani (Sakshi), Disha Patani(Priyanka) have given their best too. Well, now I must talk about the cinematography, here Santosh Thundiyil has done a brilliant job. Especially Dhoni's train capturing scene leaving his job and Dhoni's coming out of the dressing room scene during the World Cup (2011) Final help a lot to excel this film. Undoubtedly fantastic cinematography it has. As a director Neeraj Pandey is of course successful but somewhere it has lacked a bit of his special touch. Though it doesn't matter because you will not find a single moment that can make you bore. The story has real gravity and it successfully has followed the tag line i.e "The man you know... The journey you don't". Truly it has focused on his journey- his struggle, ups and downs etc. The dialogues are very inspiring and heart-touching at many places. It is around 190mins' movie. You may think it's quite long but trust me after watching it you'll think if it could be of 5 hours that would have been perfect.... Even the Dhoni-haters can't deny that.. Actually there's so much to tell about. Anyway, let's come to the background sound... Truly effective though at some points it could have been better. Except that the editing has been done quite well but truly it's the place where it has lacked a bit. At few points it seems to be less glued... sudden turn of the movements and emotions is visible. And another important part is the story line which is of course very good but few interesting points it has actually missed. It would have been much more better if there's a bit more details about few facts like Wicket Keeping, Yuvi, Dressing Room situation after the WC2011 Final. But still it's fine as I have said earlier that it has focused more on Dhoni as a man.. especially his journey... Otherwise it is actually excellent... Or better to say super-excellent! And oh yes casting is just amazing.</p>
