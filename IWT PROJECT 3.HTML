        <h3 style="color:cornflowerblue;">Story Line</h3>
        <p>Shuddh Desi Romance is the journey of three restless young people who junk the society's syllabus for finding love and decide to follow their heart. 
            Raghu (Sushant Singh Rajput), a tourist guide in Jaipur, wants a love in his life, and that's it. 
            The rest he's going to figure out along the way.
            Gayatri (Parineeti Chopra), a part-time instructor in an English speaking institute, has
            been around the block a few times and knows the scene, warts and all. Tara (Vaani Kapoor),
            who's dying to get out there and fly, knows what's right for her, but a little experimenting 
            never hurt anybody, did it? When their lives crisscross, their beliefs get challenged, and
            their loves, tested.We all want it all...the love, the attraction, the relationship, the commitment. But when we get it, it may not be in the way we recognise.</p>
        <h3>User Reviews</h3>
        <p>There's SOMETHING about this movie which is appealing. Some sequences are so alluring, it revs up your enthusiasm but some sequences shut them down permanently erasing the previously hatched-up zeal. Shuddh Desi Romance is thus an experimental coming-of-age flick which is laudable for its virility, but easily forgettable due to its monotony (and/or mindlessness).

            Sushanth Sigh Rajput's character is that of a recital bachelor who has some authenticity instilled into it. While on the other hand, the women's characters play see-saw here. Parineeti Chopra is, in her usual air, dashing, but I am not that impressed with the newcomer's acting. Rishi Kapoor completes the humor part.
            
            The plot is funny at times, serious in many nodes & significantly pragmatic throughout the narration. The individual shots of the three main leads in-between the average screenplay is one annoying thing collectively. Entertainment is delivered, but sporadically. Unless & until the viewer is prepared to dig deep inside the plot & carve him/herself to be comfy with the on screen steamy scenes, he/she wouldn't have enough food for thought. Otherwise, SDR talks something serious & relevant for the current generation.
            
            To sum it all up, a statement in the movie "Has the idea of marriage befallen?" truly is one lovable thing about the rather emotional movie.</p>
