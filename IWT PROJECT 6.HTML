        <h3 style="color: cornflowerblue;">Story Line</h3>
        <p>The setup was within 1990's till present where Anni, a divorcee used his past experience in overcoming challenges of being a loser in college where he met His Wife, Maya and his Losers friends, Saxa, Mummy, Acid, Derek and Bevda. His shares past experience to his son, Raghav who struggles with being failed at getting an offer to college despite being an excellent student.</p>
        <h3>User Reviews</h3>
        <p>Stress and overwhelming anxiety is a reality for many young students in India. More so, for those who appear for highly competitive engineering and medical entrance exams. And sometimes, ones who do not make it through the criteria find themselves in a whirlpool of doubt and depression. Unable to take the failure in the face of family and peer pressure, they often resort to actions which can cause irreparable damage to themselves and their families.
            While this bleak reality is at the center of Chhichhore’s narrative, its heart and soul is purely reserved for the carefree college and hostel days that shape lifelong bonds and life lessons.
        <br><br>
        The arc of the screenplay though is mostly predictable and has a 'Three Idiots' hangover. And with a lengthy runtime of almost two and half hours, the pace lags in the second half. It’s the emotional drama, fun quotient and a surprise element in the climax that keeps one invested. Shraddha Kapoor, packs in a solid performance both as the younger and older Maya. Sushant Singh Rajput shines as the young Anni (watch out for the scene where he goes tongue-tied in front of Maya!), however as the older Annirudh he seems a little uncomfortable. In fact, as the young lot – the performances are consistent - Varun Sharma steals the show in many of the scenes with his comic timing. Tahir Raj Bhasin is impressive as the intense Derek. Naveen Polishetty, Prateik Babbar, Tushar Pandey and Saharsh Singh also enhance the film with their likeable performances. Together, as a group of friends, they have an easy camaraderie that’s relatable.
